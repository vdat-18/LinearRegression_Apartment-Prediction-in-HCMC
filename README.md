# 🏡 Apartment Price Prediction in HCMC Project
This project involves analyzing Apartment data and using linear regression to predict Apartment prices. The primary goal is to process, explore, and visualize data from Apartment data and build a predictive model to estimate Apartment prices based on relevant features.

## 🕸️ Data Scraping
The data for this project was gathered using a web scraping process. To view the data scraping files and code, refer to the [Real Estate Scraping Repository](https://github.com/vdat-18/Real-Estate-Scraping). This repository contains the scripts used to collect raw Apartment data from various real estate listing websites, which were then processed and used in this analysis.

## 📁 Files in the Project
### 1. 📝 Linear Regression.ipynb
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code to analyze and predict Apartment prices using linear regression.
- **Purpose**: The notebook guides users through loading the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning and preprocessing data, building a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance.
- **Contents**: Common steps include data loading, visualization, handling missing values, data transformation, model training, and prediction.

### 2. 📄 Real_Estate_data.xlsx
- **Description**: This Excel file contains Apartment data, including various features that influence property prices.
- **Purpose**: This dataset serves as the primary source for training and evaluating the linear regression model.
- **Contents**: Expected columns may include property features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, age of the property, and price.

## 📊 Project Overview
1. **Data Collection**: The Apartment data was collected from various listings to provide a diverse dataset for property price prediction.
2. **Data Processing**: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistics are used to explore the relationships between features and the target variable (price).
4. **Modeling**: A linear regression model is developed to predict property prices based on features in the dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
